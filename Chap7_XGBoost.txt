Features:
    It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. 
    XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM). 
    The same code runs on major distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) 
    It can solve problems beyond billions of examples
    training with multiple GPUs is only supported for Linux platform
